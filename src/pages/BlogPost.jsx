They notice it in their staff and in the artists they commission or the housekeeper who moves through the world without performance, the painter who walks into the room already belonging to something the patron will never be admitted to. What they covet most is precisely what their abundance and influence cannot reach: ease, lineage, the unforced confidence of a life that did not have to be assembled. They can hire the people who have it. They cannot become them. The artists with inherited legitimacy is somethng they view with envy and awe. Despite them inheriting nearly everything else. And so the resentment underneath dressed up as taste, dressed up as discernment, dressed up as anything other than what it is that lingers on their face.
